After installing the ABC model from https://github.com/broadinstitute/ABC-Enhancer-Gene-Prediction according to their instructions, use `download_data.sh` to download the data required. Place the config `config_biosamples_HAP1_EncodeHiC_withDNAse.tsv` into the `config` directory, and replace the `config.yaml` file in the `config` directory with the one in this directory. Then run the ABC model as specified in the github to generate the output.

For a pre-calculated thresholded `bedpe.gz` prediction output, see output directory.
